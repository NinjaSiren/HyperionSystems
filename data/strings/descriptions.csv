HS_Alycone,SHIP,"An old cruiser design, originally designed back at the middle of the Human Domain-era. It was originally manufactured by Hyperion Systems Earth Branch, but the blueprints were quickly shipped to other branches before the collapse happened.",,,
HS_Arcturus,SHIP,"A re-design or a refit of the venerable Prometheus-class heavy tanker, it was conceived by some of the Hegemony's Freight Union to increase the delivery of fuel across the Persean Sector against the original Prometheus. With additional defences of course.",,,

It was recovered by Hyperion Systems in one of Persean Sector's gates in an old, abandoned, and damaged Betelgeuse-class Superfreighter originally owned by the 113th Militarized Freight Group that was killed-in-action by swarms of pirates and looters at the Persean Sector as the try to re-activate a gate to another system.",,,

,,,,,
HS_Atlas_Confederacy,SHIP,"This was a move by the Hyperion Confederacy did becuase of the restrictions of the Hegemony and the Hyperion Systems Corporation to give the Confederacy a blueprint to the Hyperion Systems' Betelgeuse-class Superfreighter, so they ended up modifying an Atlas-class Superfreighter  and added a bunch of additional weapon and armor parts.",,,
