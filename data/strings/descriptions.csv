HS_Alycone,SHIP,"An old cruiser design, originally designed back at the middle of the Human Domain-era. It was originally manufactured by Hyperion Systems Earth Branch, but the blueprints were quickly shipped to other branches before the collapse happened.",,,
HS_Arcturus,SHIP,"A re-design or a refit of the venerable Prometheus-class heavy tanker, it was conceived by some of the Hegemony's Freight Union to increase the delivery of fuel across the Persean Sector against the original Prometheus. With additional defences of course.",,,
HS_Bellatrix,SHIP,This phased cruiser was idealized by the Hyperion Systems Persean Sector Jangala Branch back just after the collapse of the Human Domain occurred. This ship was the primary defence of the Hyperion Systems Persean Sector for defending it's trade secrets to the growing problem of anarchy in the system.,,,
HS_Betelgeuse,SHIP,"It is one of the original freighter ship designed by Hyperion Systems' rivals Arcjet Corporation. This was one of the primary freight used by the Human Domain's primary military freight service, but then quickly lost when the collapse happened.",,,
HS_Carinae,SHIP,"Originally designed as a light-to-medium freighter back at the Human Domain-era, it was one of Hyperion Systems' original ships and it was converted into a crew transport just before the collapse. Now it is redesigned as a destroyer of some kind.",,,
HS_Cassiopeia,SHIP,"This ship is one of the original frigates of the Human Domain Planet Bombardment Fleet, one of this ship is originally used for destroying one large area of a planet from its large, dish-like weapon that was replaced internally with a Thermal Pulse Cannon.",,,
HS_Eridani,SHIP,A late Human Domain-era frigate that was originally deployed as a way to counter the defeat in the Battle for Earth. It was then quickly re-manufactured by Hyperion Systems right after the collapse for additional protection of interests.,,,
HS_Icarus,SHIP,"The successor of the Carinae-class Troop Transport, it is a re-design of the Starliner-class Civilian Transport, redesigned for military troop transport and deployment to planets. Hyperion Systems was chosen to re-design the Starliner-class to a military variant by the Hegemony.",,,
HS_Naos,SHIP,"The Naos-class Supercruiser was one of the original capital-class ships designed by Hyperion Systems back at the Human Domain-era. It was one of the original ships that was sent as a seedship to colonize other planets via the multi-generational ship. Though, through the years it was slowly redesigned as a Capital-class battleship.",,,
HS_Orionis,SHIP,"This ship is one of the original phase-based ships to be designed back at the Human Domain-era. It was originally designed as an experiment, a X-class ship dedicated for studiying phase technology. It was almost lost when the collapse happened, but it was then jump gated by the commander of the ship to the Persean System as a way to escape the problems in the Sol System. It ended up into Hyperion Systems' Persean Sector's orbital laboratories and was re-designed as a phased battleship and manufactured.",,,
HS_Sirius,SHIP,"The Sirius-class phase destroyer was originally a non-phased destroyer designed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation in the middle of the Human Domain-era. It was then shelved but when the collapse happened the original blueprints were lost in one of the systems near the Persean Sector. It was recovered by Hyperion Systems in one of Persean Sector's gates in an old, abandoned, and damaged Betelgeuse-class Superfreighter originally owned by the 113th Militarized Freight Group that was killed-in-action by swarms of pirates and looters at the Persean Sector as the try to re-activate a gate to another system.",,,
